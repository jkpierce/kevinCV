		\item Produced a Landlab ``Education and Knowledge Transfer" lab, now hosted on the \href{https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Labs_portal}{Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System website} as an example of how to use the Landlab modeling suite to evaluate the impact of wildfires on landscape evolution.

	\end{itemizeit}
\end{itemize}


\section*{Professional Experience}
\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf Postdoctoral Research Associate}, University of British Columbia. \hfill (Oct. 2021 -- Present)

\begin{itemizeit} 
	\item Conducting laboratory flume experiments on grain-scale sediment transport processes, using high-speed cameras and a variety of image analysis techniques, including structure from motion, particle image velociometry, and particle tracking velociometry. We are studying sediment entrainment mechanics with particular emphasis on the role of collisions in bed load sediment transport.
    \item Producing probabilistic models of sediment entrainment based on the representation of turbulent flow forces as a random time series.
	\item Developing a discrete element simulation of sediment transport using angular (non-spherical) grains to understand the impact of particle shape on the stability and transport characteristics of coarse sediment.
	\item Surveying steep mountain channels with Unmanned aerial vehicles and structure from motion to determine the stability and history of alluvial reaches in otherwise colluvial channels.

\end{itemizeit}

\item {\bf Course Content Developer}, UBC Geography Department. \hfill (Nov. 2020 -- Sep. 2021)

	\begin{itemizeit} 
		\item Produced a 45 minute video documentary of a geomorphology field trip in collaboration with a professor and an audio-visual specialist for use in a 4th year undergraduate fluvial geomorphology course. This film educates students on processes and features of mountain river channels and replaced the in-person field trip which would have normally been taken if not for COVID.
		\item Developed five laboratory assignments for a first year undergraduate geomorphology course. A virtual field trip to the Tacoma watershed of Mount Rainier is presented to students using Tapestry, while data sets and assignments from the watershed are provided for students in Canvas. Using these data sets, students analyze hillslope stability, volcanic processes, river morphology, climate change, and glacial processes for their course laboratory component.
		\item Delivered several video explanations of ecological ideas which were incorporated into a virtual field trip phone application for a first year geography course on climate and ecosystems. Students travel to Vancouver parks and hear these video lectures when they reach the location they were originally filmed. This effort was completed with grant funding to introduce alternative technologies into Earth Science education.
		\item Constructed five laboratory assignments for students in a third year undergraduate "Statistics in Geography" course. Students obtain the assignment packet from Github and perform inferential statistics calculations on real-world data sets.
		\item Students perform calculations using R in Jupyter notebooks hosted on a Cloud Computing server.  As they complete the assignments, students make conclusions on real-world pollution, ecology, climate, and social problems during the assignments as they learn R programming, cloud computing, version control, bash scripting, and statistical analysis techniques.
	\end{itemizeit}
